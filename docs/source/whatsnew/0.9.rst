Changes in 0.9.0
=================
    * Restricted to Python 3.6 and more recent.  If you are still using Python 2.7, you should remain with the 0.8.x series.
    * Backwards incompatibility: the read_bands method no longer takes the layer argument, you must set this using the layer property.
    * Backwards incompatibility: the icc_profile member of the ColourSpecificationBox is no longer a dictionary of metadata, but is instead a series of raw bytes that may be read by any software capable of interpreting ICC profiles.  The dictionary of metadata has been renamed to "icc_profile_header".
